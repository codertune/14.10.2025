# Credential Management Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive credential management system that allows users to test, update, and manage their Bangladesh Bank portal credentials directly from the dashboard, with real-time notifications for credential failures.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration Required)

**New Tables Created:**
- `notifications` - Stores user notifications for various events
- `notification_preferences` - User preferences for notification types

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `portal_credentials` - Added columns for credential testing and failure tracking:
  - `last_test_at` - Timestamp of last credential test
  - `last_test_success` - Result of last test (boolean)
  - `failure_count` - Count of consecutive failures
  - `last_failure_at` - Timestamp of last failure

**Migration File:** `database/migration_notifications_system.sql`

**To Run Migration:**
```bash
node run-notifications-migration.cjs
```

### 2. Backend API Enhancements

**New API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/credentials/test` - Test portal credentials without running full automation
- `GET /api/notifications/:userId` - Get user notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/:userId/unread-count` - Get unread notification count
- `PUT /api/notifications/:notificationId/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/:userId/read-all` - Mark all notifications as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:notificationId` - Delete a notification
- `GET /api/notification-preferences/:userId` - Get notification preferences
- `PUT /api/notification-preferences/:userId` - Update notification preferences

**New Database Service Methods:**
- `updateCredentialTestResult()` - Track credential test results
- `createNotification()` - Create user notifications
- `getUserNotifications()` - Retrieve notifications
- `getUnreadNotificationCount()` - Get unread count
- `markNotificationAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
- `markAllNotificationsAsRead()` - Mark all as read
- `deleteNotification()` - Delete notification
- `getUserNotificationPreferences()` - Get preferences
- `updateNotificationPreferences()` - Update preferences

### 3. Python Automation Script Updates

**File:** `automation_scripts/bb_exp_search.py`

**New Features:**
- Added `--test-only` flag support for credential validation
- Script exits immediately after successful login when testing
- Returns appropriate exit codes:
  - `0` - Success
  - `2` - Invalid credentials
  - Other - General errors

### 4. Job Queue Integration

**File:** `server/services/jobQueue.cjs`

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Detects exit code 2 (invalid credentials)
- Automatically creates notification when credentials fail
- Updates credential failure tracking
- Provides actionable error messages with links to update credentials

### 5. Frontend Components

#### NotificationBell Component
**Location:** `src/components/NotificationBell.tsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time notification bell in header
- Badge showing unread count
- Dropdown panel with notifications
- Mark as read/delete actions
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Direct links to action pages
- Formatted timestamps (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago")

**Integration:** Added to Header component next to cart icon

#### Enhanced PortalCredentialsModal
**Location:** `src/components/PortalCredentialsModal.tsx`

**New Features:**
- "Test Credentials" button
- Real-time credential validation
- Visual feedback for test results
- Success/failure messages
- Loading states during testing
- Disabled state management during operations

### 6. User Experience Improvements

**Dashboard Access:**
- Users can access credential management from:
  - Account Settings > Portal Access tab
  - Notification action buttons (direct link)
  - User menu in header

**Notification System:**
- In-app notifications appear in real-time
- Notifications include:
  - Credential failure alerts
  - Direct "Update Credentials" links
  - Job completion notices (future)
  - Credit low warnings (future)

**Credential Testing:**
- Test credentials before saving
- Validate without running expensive automation
- Get immediate feedback (15-60 seconds)
- See specific error messages

## User Workflows

### Updating Credentials

1. User clicks bell icon in header
2. Sees "Portal Credentials Invalid" notification
3. Clicks "Update Credentials" button
4. Redirected to Account Settings > Portal Access tab
5. Clicks "Update" on Bangladesh Bank EXP Portal card
6. Enters new credentials
7. Clicks "Test Credentials" button
8. Sees success/failure message
9. If successful, clicks "Update Credentials" to save
10. Returns to dashboard and can run automation

### Testing Credentials

1. Navigate to Account Settings > Portal Access
2. Click "Update" on portal card
3. Enter or modify credentials
4. Click "Test Credentials"
5. Wait 15-60 seconds for validation
6. See result:
   - ✓ Green success message
   - ✗ Red error with specific issue
7. Fix issues and test again if needed
8. Save when working correctly

### Handling Automation Failures

**Automatic Process:**
1. User runs automation with invalid credentials
2. Automation fails with exit code 2
3. System automatically:
   - Refunds user credits
   - Creates notification
   - Updates credential failure count
   - Tracks failure timestamp
4. User sees notification in bell icon
5. User clicks notification to go directly to credential update
6. User updates and tests credentials
7. User can retry automation

## Technical Details

### Notification Types

- `credential_failure` - Portal login credentials invalid
- `job_complete` - Automation job finished (future)
- `credit_low` - User credits below threshold (future)
- Custom types can be added easily

### Security

- Credentials remain encrypted in database
- Test endpoint requires user authentication
- Notifications are user-specific with RLS policies
- Test process creates temporary files that are auto-deleted
- No credentials are logged or exposed

### Performance

- Notification polling every 30 seconds
- Lightweight unread count queries
- Indexed database queries for fast retrieval
- Test process timeout after 60 seconds
- Temporary test files cleaned automatically

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` - Database connection
- Python and automation script paths from existing config

### Database Connection

System works with existing PostgreSQL database. Supabase can be used as alternative with migration adjustments.
